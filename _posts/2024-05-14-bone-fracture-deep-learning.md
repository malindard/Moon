# Introduction

The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model to classify bone fractures using X-ray images. This task is crucial for automating the diagnosis process, potentially reducing the time required for analysis and increasing the diagnostic accuracy. The chosen model leverages the MobileNetV2 architecture, a pre-trained convolutional neural network optimized for image classification tasks. This approach aims to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between fractured and non-fractured bone images.

#### Dataset
The dataset consists of X-ray images labeled as 'fractured' and 'not fractured'. It is divided into three sets: training, validation, and testing, with a total of 9240 training images, 823 validation images, and 500 test images.

#### Data Preprocessing
The images are preprocessed using data augmentation techniques including random flip, brightness adjustment, contrast adjustment, saturation adjustment, and hue adjustment to enhance the modelâ€™s robustness. The images are resized to 224x224 pixels, normalized, and augmented to improve generalization.

# Model Architecture
#### Base Model
MobileNetV2: Utilized for its efficiency and effectiveness in image classification tasks, with pre-trained weights on ImageNet. The top layer is removed to allow for custom classification.
#### Custom Layers
* Flatten Layer: Converts the 2D feature maps to 1D feature vectors.
* Dense Layer: A fully connected layer with 512 neurons and ReLU activation.
* Dropout Layer: Applied with a rate of 0.5 to reduce overfitting.
* Output Layer: A Dense layer with 2 neurons and sigmoid activation for binary classification.


# Result
#### Training and Validation Metrics
* Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of 97.67% on the training set and 94.53% on the validation set after 10 epochs.
* Loss: The training loss decreased steadily, with validation loss showing minor fluctuation

#### Test Set Evaluation
The model was evaluated on the test dataset. The classification report shows the following metrics:
* Accuracy: 94.80%
* Precision: 94.79%
* Recall: 94.79%
* F1 Score: 94.79%


# Conclusion

The model demonstrates high accuracy in classifying bone fractures from X-ray images, achieving nearly 95% accuracy on the test set. The use of MobileNetV2, combined with data augmentation and fine-tuned hyperparameters, proved effective in this binary classification task. Future work could explore additional data augmentation techniques, fine-tuning the model further, or experimenting with different architectures to potentially improve performance.
